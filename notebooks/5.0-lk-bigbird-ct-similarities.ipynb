       "4  this module aims to provide an introduction to research methods and the formulation of research questions. the module is taken by both bsc and i am students. the bsc students will combine this course with the research methods in practice course in year 2, enabling students to understand the application of research methods to the clinical contexts in which they will be working using evidence based principles. the i am students will combine years and with more advanced study leading to the dissertation in years and throughout the course, learning is cumulative, one year building on another, with concepts recurring and developing over the course. the main objective of this course is to help you understand the principles of experimental design and provide you with an introduction to statistics. we hope that after you complete this course you will be able to understand how a diverse range of research methods are employed to collect data, to analyse data systematically, to describe data faithfully, to formulate hypotheses and use data to evaluate those hypotheses. the concepts, knowledge and skills this course introduces are also fundamental to just about every other course you will follow: you will need material from this course for your child study, for all your clinical placement case studies and case presentations throughout your programme. you will need to have learned all the material to make any sense of the psychology courses, child development modules, speech language pathology courses. every article you read, test you evaluate, treatment you plan, diagnosis you propose, prognosis you make, essay you write will require recourse to concepts, facts and techniques which you will start to learn about in this course. the course will be delivered as a mixture of lectures, lab sessions and participation in research studies. for students studying the clinical programmes (bsc speech & language therapy and masters of speech & language sciences), the hcpc standards of proficiency are of relevance. 14.12 recognise the value of research to the critical evaluation of practice 14.13 be aware of a range of research methodologies syllabus covers: introduction to the course. different sorts of enquiry and research methods. evidence based practice as a framework, population vs. samples. descriptive vs. inferential statistics. measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode. measures of dispersion: ranges, mean deviation, standard deviation; standard error. frequency distributions. normal distribution and its properties. standard scores: z scores, t scores, percentiles. parametric vs. nonparametric statistics. types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio. basic experimental designs: between subjects and within subjects. dependent and independent variables. hypotheses and tails. hypothesis testing: probability, significance, alpha levels, type i and ii errors. introduction to inferential statistics. choosing tests. lab: introduction to spss. nonparametric tests for one and two samples nominal data. lab: nonparametric tests for comparing two samples ordinal data. lab: nonparametric tests for comparing three or more samples. lab: parametric tests for comparing one, two and three samples: t tests, one way analysis of variance. lab: correlation measures: tests of association and relation. revision for the semester and preparation for class test. semester and semester completion of a total of three hours of research work as a participant, from a range of experimental research studies available (or completion of a word essay on a subject connected with research design or ethics to be agreed with the module leader). for students studying the clinical programmes (bsc speech & language therapy and masters of speech & language sciences), relevant aspects of rcslt curriculum guidelines: this module contributes to the key graduate capabilities around research and evidence based practice (4.2.4), with a focus on section b research skills and methods allowing the students to demonstrate the knowledge and skills required to understand, interpret and apply research to practice.  knowledge of the principles underlying experimental design knowledge of experimental and correlational techniques, including conceptual foundations (ii) knowledge of when it is appropriate to use these, and (iii) potential pitfalls.  ability to create an experimental design to address a specific hypothesis. ability to prepare data ready for a statistical analysis ability to use a range of statistical techniques to analyse data (non parametric and parametric statistics using with and between group design) using appropriate statistical software (e.g. spss)   \n",

suppose we find an association between age and body mass index, how can we study if this association varies between men and women, or between those with different educational backgrounds? in this course we consider the issues involved when we wish to construct realistic and useful statistical models for problems which can arise in a range of fields: medicine, finance, social research and environmental issues being some of the main areas. we revise multiple linear regression models, and see how they are special cases of a general linear model. we move on to consider analysis of variance (anova) as another special case of a general linear model – this is the problem of investigating contrasts between different levels of a factor in affecting a response and then we generalize to the case of several factors. we consider analysis of covariance (ancova) which involves mixing linear regression and factor effects, and the idea of interaction between explanatory variables in the way they affect a response. the module provides a comprehensive introduction to the issues involved in using statistics to model real data, and to draw relevant conclusions. there is an emphasis on hands on application of the theory and methods throughout, with extensive use of r. the second part of the module builds on the first part (linear modelling) by introducing a generalized framework of models which allow us to generalize away from normally distributed errors to different kinds of random outcomes, building in an appropriate transformation of the linear function of explanatory variables to match. we note that the general linear models studied in the first part of the module exist as a special case. we generalize linear models to study the topic of generalized linear models, allowing us to build non linear relationships into our models, and to study many different types of outcome measure which could not have been handled using general linear models. we consider asymptotic maximum likelihood estimation for the multi parameter case, including the use of information matrices in parameter estimation and likelihood ratio tests for comparing nested models. these ideas are applied to generalized linear models. we study in depth the special cases involved with binomial outcomes, logistic regression, where we are interested in how explanatory variables affect the success rate, and then log linear models, which enable us to study among other things, contingency tables involving more than two factors. this module opens up the possibility to study many kinds of real life situations which were inaccessible to linear models, allowing us to study many realistic and important problems. there is an emphasis on hands on application of the theory and methods throughout, with extensive use of r. the general linear model: maximum likelihood in the multi parameter case; estimation of parameters; prediction; model adequacy; regression, anova and ancova as special cases. model choice. analysis of designs with 1, or factors. model identifiability, parameter constraints and dummy variables. use of transformations. various extended examples of statistical modelling using r. generalized linear models: overall construction as generalization of linear models; binomial regression with various links; poisson regression; log linear models and their use for contingency tables. asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator in the multi parameter case. the exponential family of distributions. various extended examples of statistical modelling using r. students will know the theory and techniques of modelling normal outcomes in terms of categorical and continuous covariates using the general linear model. the students will extend their knowledge of the theory of general linear models to encompass outcomes from several non normal exponential family distributions. they will understand asymptotic maximum likelihood theory for multi parameter distributions, and the exponential family of distributions. the ability to determine the appropriate statistical model to use, to be able to use r to fit the model and to be able to interpret the fitted model. the ability to identify the kind of design and modelling approaches needed to address a wide variety of real life statistical problems, and the ability to implement appropriate statistical modelling procedures using r. the ability to identify the kind of modelling approaches needed to address a wide variety of real life statistical problems, and the ability to implement appropriate statistical modelling procedures using r.</td>\n",

an ability to apply this philosophical framework to the changing historical and cultural contexts in which the module texts were written and read; an understanding of the evolution of contemporary anxieties surrounding gender, class, race and nationhood; a detailed knowledge of the content and formal aspects of the set texts; an ability to evaluate contemporary and current critical positions on the set texts. by the end of the module, students should be able to: critically compare and contrast different texts and contexts; offer historically and theoretically informed insights into specific texts both orally and in writing; assimilate and evaluate information from a number of different literary, critical and contextual sources; bring a thorough understanding of the generic and formal aspects of the set texts to analysing module themes; produce with others, in small groups, notes and oral presentations; reflect upon their participation and essay writing skills via a combination of formative and summative assignments.   \n",
       "1  to achieve an understanding of linear models, and how regression, analysis of variance (anova) and analysis of covariance (ancova) models arise as special cases. to understand the problem of identifiability in anova, and the role played by parameter constraints and dummy variables in solving it. to achieve an understanding of generalized linear models and achieve familiarity with the most common families, understanding how logistic regression and log linear models arise as special cases. to understand asymptotic maximum likelihood theory for more than one parameter and its application to generalized linear models. to understand the exponential family, and demonstrate that certain distributions belong to this. module summary the first part of this module is concerned with building and applying statistical models for data. how does a mixture of quantitative and qualitative variables affect the body mass index of an individual? suppose we find an association between age and body mass index, how can we study if this association varies between men and women, or between those with different educational backgrounds? in this course we consider the issues involved when we wish to construct realistic and useful statistical models for problems which can arise in a range of fields: medicine, finance, social research and environmental issues being some of the main areas. we revise multiple linear regression models, and see how they are special cases of a general linear model. we move on to consider analysis of variance (anova) as another special case of a general linear model – this is the problem of investigating contrasts between different levels of a factor in affecting a response and then we generalize to the case of several factors. we consider analysis of covariance (ancova) which involves mixing linear regression and factor effects, and the idea of interaction between explanatory variables in the way they affect a response. the module provides a comprehensive introduction to the issues involved in using statistics to model real data, and to draw relevant conclusions. there is an emphasis on hands on application of the theory and methods throughout, with extensive use of r. the second part of the module builds on the first part (linear modelling) by introducing a generalized framework of models which allow us to generalize away from normally distributed errors to different kinds of random outcomes, building in an appropriate transformation of the linear function of explanatory variables to match. we note that the general linear models studied in the first part of the module exist as a special case. we generalize linear models to study the topic of generalized linear models, allowing us to build non linear relationships into our models, and to study many different types of outcome measure which could not have been handled using general linear models. we consider asymptotic maximum likelihood estimation for the multi parameter case, including the use of information matrices in parameter estimation and likelihood ratio tests for comparing nested models. these ideas are applied to generalized linear models. we study in depth the special cases involved with binomial outcomes, logistic regression, where we are interested in how explanatory variables affect the success rate, and then log linear models, which enable us to study among other things, contingency tables involving more than two factors. this module opens up the possibility to study many kinds of real life situations which were inaccessible to linear models, allowing us to study many realistic and important problems. there is an emphasis on hands on application of the theory and methods throughout, with extensive use of r. the general linear model: maximum likelihood in the multi parameter case; estimation of parameters; prediction; model adequacy; regression, anova and ancova as special cases. model choice. analysis of designs with 1, or factors. model identifiability, parameter constraints and dummy variables. use of transformations. various extended examples of statistical modelling using r. generalized linear models: overall construction as generalization of linear models; binomial regression with various links; poisson regression; log linear models and their use for contingency tables. asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator in the multi parameter case. the exponential family of distributions. various extended examples of statistical modelling using r. students will know the theory and techniques of modelling normal outcomes in terms of categorical and continuous covariates using the general linear model. the students will extend their knowledge of the theory of general linear models to encompass outcomes from several non normal exponential family distributions. they will understand asymptotic maximum likelihood theory for multi parameter distributions, and the exponential family of distributions. the ability to determine the appropriate statistical model to use, to be able to use r to fit the model and to be able to interpret the fitted model. the ability to identify the kind of design and modelling approaches needed to address a wide variety of real life statistical problems, and the ability to implement appropriate statistical modelling procedures using r. the ability to identify the kind of modelling approaches needed to address a wide variety of real life statistical problems, and the ability to implement appropriate statistical modelling procedures using r.   \n",

                                              this module will provide students with a core understanding of evolutionary theory and biology, designed specifically for students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds in behavioural sciences. the module will give students an understanding of the historical context of evolutionary theory through a brief history of evolutionary biology, and progress into a detailed understanding of the modern synthesis and associated concepts. finally, the course will engage the students in applying these concepts to human behaviour in particular, covering current research in behavioural ecology, evolutionary medicine and cultural evolution. as well as providing a primer for the core concepts of modern evolutionary theory and practice, the course situates evolutionary biology in a wider context, covering the historical development of evolutionary theory, its philosophical ramifications, and its impacts and applications in the human social, behavioral and health sciences. the module is primarily designed as a unifying thread for the mres strand in evolution and human behaviour, but students from other strands are welcome and will not be at a disadvantage. the module will start with an introductory session and then include material on the following topics: o principles of evolutionary biology o history of life and the hominid line o variation and heredity o competition and selection o population genetics o genetics and behaviour o cooperation, competition and game theory o plasticity and learning o language and communication o gene culture co evolution o cultural evolution o complex systems and collective behaviour on completing the module students should be able to: display a firm grasp of the intellectual history of evolutionary biology and what evolutionary theory aims to explain 2.discuss the mechanisms that give rise to adaptation and the biological evidence for evolutionary processes 3.explain the core the concepts in evolutionary theory and how these can be applied to the study of human and behaviour and culture on completion of the module students should be able to: communicate clearly and informedly about evolutionary theory in historical context, particularly as it applies to human behaviour, including contentious issues in this application critically and constructively evaluate research in the behavioural sciences in an evolutionary context apply evolutionary thinking to empirical studies of behaviour, e.g., in developing ideas for a research project.   \n",

labour markets as \"special\" institutions; the employment of migrant workers; bodies at work; minds at work; and, the professionalisation of hrm. the syllabus may change from year to year to reflect current research. topics likely to be include, but are not limited to: thinking differently about global organisational structures thinking differently about labour market institutions thinking differently about migration, work, and employment thinking differently about bodies at work: aesthetic and emotional labour thinking differently about minds at work thinking differently about the professionalisation of the hr function  use social theory to understanding of key issues within contemporary work and organizations, and how these relate to the practices of hrm. understand the relationship between diverse individuals, different workplace experiences and contemporary workplace settings. to understand contemporary social trends and the consequences of these for workers, organization and the possibilities of hrm critically discuss the role of power and social institutions in affecting social processes at work and how these impact hrm. explain and evaluate the relationship between individuals, institutions and wider societal structures. at the end of the module students should be able to evaluate and critically debate the relationship between individual, work, organisations and wider society, and the role of hrm within this context. they should be able to use social theory to understand and evaluate contemporary workplaces settings. they should understand the practical implication of contemporary social processes for the history, emergence and potential of hrm.   \n",
