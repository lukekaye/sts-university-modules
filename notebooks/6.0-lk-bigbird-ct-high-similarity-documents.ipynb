                           in this module the apprentices will learn about the security principles and considerations that should be adopted in the software engineering process from requirements, design, through to development and testing. the module also puts a particular emphasis on the ethical, legal and social considerations of software engineering when applied to the workplace. *apprentices and their employers who wish to apply a project from their workplace must consult with the module leader to ensure the scope is manageable in the semester, and the project criteria is met. the module will cover cyber security: o the need for security o foundations of security o privacy o practical security o information governance: ethical, legal and social issues involved in data management and analysis ethical, social and legal consideration in cyber security to be able to describe and discuss: the information governance requirements that exist in the uk, and the relevant organisational and legislative data protection and data security standards that exist the basic tenets of computer security: confidentiality, integrity and availability authentication and access control problems and their solutions introduction to symmetric and asymmetric (public key) cryptography examples of uses of cryptography for confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non

aspects, which can all be exploited by attackers. users are often wrongly portrayed as “the weakest link”, when the problem lies in the lack of a usable and secure system. the security analysis of a complex system therefore requires a holistic approach, leveraging a range of techniques. the aim of this module is to study techniques required for complex systems, using concrete case studies as well as exploring possible future attacks. the module covers, through the study of research papers and technical reports, attacks against complex systems, as well as techniques to detect, respond to and prevent such attacks. the complex systems studied during the module will reflect current research and technical challenges, for example: industrial control systems and cyber physical infrastructure, social engineering techniques, human aspects of security, forensics analysis, or machine learning based intrusion and misuse detection.  security of complex systems (e.g., industrial control systems, smart grids) sophisticated attack mechanisms (e.g., adversarial machine learning) usable security and privacy social engineering techniques the ability to describe and discuss: the interaction of security of social, cyber and physical aspects in complex systems, and their impact on the security of the whole system. the role of human users in the security and privacy of complex systems. the possible security mechanisms to detect, respond to and prevent attacks against complex systems.  the ability to analyse and summarise key research papers related to the security of complex systems. the ability to suggest and recommend security mechanisms for a specific complex system.   \n","3

security testing strategies including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and ethical hacking.  this module will look at a range of security tools and analysis, covering: definition of ethical hacking network analysis (such as host discovery and traffic analysis) web application analysis (such as xss and vulnerability reporting) operating system analysis (such as privilege escalation and buffer exploitation) cryptography analysis (such as brute force on hashing) malware analysis (such as reverse engineering and intrusion detection) forensics analysis (such as steganography and log analysis) the ability to describe and discuss: how to select and tools and techniques to carry out a variety of security testing strategies the fundamentals of ethical hacking the ability to: plan and carry out testing a variety of security testing strategies identify, investigate and correlate actionable security events conduct a vulnerability assessment select and apply cyber forensic tools and techniques for attack reconstruction conduct analysis of attacker tools   \n","4

networked information and communications in our society and how it has created new legal conflicts in most areas of law. they should then be able to identify legal frameworks of regulation with which to analyse and/or resolve such conflicts students should be able to identify the applicable national and regional laws for the legal issues examined in the module and also to analyse the legal, technological, societal, political and other challenges and conflicts these areas entail. they should demonstrate an understanding of the global framework of internet law, and a background understanding of the international human rights and governance structures relevant to the area. will vary as topical events impact on what is a very dynamic area but typically drawn from: intro/ regulation of the internet privacy/ data protection :introduction to privacy, dp principles and user rights data protection 2: user rights data protection / e commerce 3: cookies, spam, profiling, marketing algorithms, machine learning, and ai : regulation of transparency and profiling state surveillance and “surveillance capitalism” online intermediaries “online harms” and intermediaries : trolling, abuse, terror and fake news cybercrime high technology topics e.g. digital assets: ai; driverless cars; care robots ; ai and the legal profession the internet has come to dominate our society over the last twenty or so years and now is of vital significance to our work and social lives, to our mental health, to our educational development and to our democratic norms. in the commercial world, the internet has transformed delivery of services and goods and expanded consumer choice and power. in terms of dysfunction, the internet has created now opportunities and venues for crime, disorder, harassment and abuse. there are arguments that the internet has transformed us into a surveillance society and that privacy is dead. all of these affect a wide variety of regulations and laws. more than this though the internet has ushered in the idea that we are as much governed by the software and hardware around us as by laws : the idea that “law is code”. it has also exposed the power not just of traditional law and policy makers but also of the private sector; and it has exposed national laws to the reality that data flows seamlessly across borders. the internet is thus a transnational legal phenomenon. the module will attempt to put over these ideas suing a series of topics drawn from privacy, data protection, e commerce, cybercrime and security, free speech and censorship online etc. there will be a particular emphasis on newer “ai” related topics such as machine learning, profiling, robots, driverless cars etc. after completing this module, learners will be able to demonstrate critical knowledge and understanding of: the economic, social, technological and historical factors important to the rise of the internet the legal instruments and principles which are key to looking at governance of the internet, including uk, eu and us legal sources as well as international human rights. the commercial, social, technological and cultural barriers to enforcement and application of law online. the notions of regulation by “code” and associated ideas such as pots (privacy optimising technologies.)  students should be able to work, individually and in groups, to provide summaries and analyses of relevant legal issues; and participate as required in group discussions and presentations, thus demonstrating oral as well as written skills, as well as coordination and completion of tasks to specifications. students should demonstrate the ability to undertake independent research on internet law topics as required throughout the course and for the essay assignment . they should show the ability to access both primary legal source materials and secondary materials, including online material; understand when each is appropriate; and use correct legal citation style. students should demonstrate the ability to understand and use the english language proficiently in relation to internet law issues; to present knowledge or an argument in a way which is comprehensible to others, even under time pressures; and to read and understand internet law materials which are written in technical and complex language.   \n","7

substantial piece of independent work which is designed based on your job role and the specialism that you are undertaking as part of the software engineering master’s level degree apprenticeship. you will have the opportunity to solve real world problem focus on live business scenarios in your workplace, develop your own specialist expertise in the project, and further improve and demonstrate your professional development skills. you will work closely with your employer and the apprenticeship tutor. specifically, the module aims to equip the apprentices with the following knowledge and skills: to deepen the knowledge, skills and behaviours acquired in the degree apprenticeship programme through practice. to develop an awareness of the range and limitations of technologies available. to develop an awareness of the real world problems in software engineering. toward the end of the programme a lead academic supervisor accompanied by multiple academic supervisors will agree upon a business related project with the apprentice’s employer and the apprentices based on the apprentice’s job role and specialism that they are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. the independent assessor of the epa (end point assessment) should present the meeting for finalising the topic for capstone project. if the apprentice or their employer needs to change the capstone project scope they must resubmit a project form for the epa assessor to approve. the agreed project will present a typical business task, appropriate for demonstrating the skills and knowledge on the standard. in every project there will be a research component and a strong design, programming and/or analytic element. project definition and planning: the agreed project will be comparable in terms of content and complexity for all apprentices – it is the context within which the knowledge, and skills must be demonstrated that will vary. the project is undertaken and completed on programme and pre gateway to the epa (end point assessment). supervision: each project has a lead supervisor and second supervisor, both staff from the school. additional supervision support may be provided by the apprentice’s employer. the apprentice and lead supervisor will meet regularly throughout the period of the project. research: background research will be undertaken in the selected topic with access to the library and online resources. development and software engineering skills: the core of the project will involve carrying out the project plan largely independently, but with guidance from the supervisors. project report: a project report will be prepared, describing the technical background, the work undertaken, the analysis of results and directions for further work. guidance on the style and content of a report will be provided by means of lectures and through the supervisor. project presentation: a mini show and share peers of their six month project, and as a way to bring a celebratory closure to the program. to be able to describe and discus: the various inputs, statements of requirements, security considerations and

years and now is of vital significance to our work and social lives, to our mental health, to our educational development and to our democratic norms. in the commercial world, the internet has transformed delivery of services and goods and expanded consumer choice and power. in terms of dysfunction, the internet has created now opportunities and venues for crime, disorder, harassment and abuse. there are arguments that the internet has transformed us into a surveillance society and that privacy is dead. all of these affect a wide variety of regulations and laws. more than this though the internet has ushered in the idea that we are as much governed by the software and hardware around us as by laws : the idea that “law is code”. it has also exposed the power not just of traditional law and policy makers but also of the private sector; and it has exposed national laws to the reality that data flows seamlessly across borders. the internet is thus a transnational legal phenomenon. the module will attempt to put over these ideas suing a series of topics drawn from privacy, data protection, e commerce, cybercrime and security, free speech and censorship online etc. there will be

in your workplace, develop your own specialist expertise in the project, and further improve and demonstrate your professional development skills. you will work closely with your employer and the apprenticeship tutor. specifically, the module aims to equip the apprentices with the following knowledge and skills: to deepen the knowledge, skills and behaviours acquired in the degree apprenticeship programme through practice. to develop an awareness of the range and limitations of technologies available. to develop an awareness of the real world problems in software engineering. toward the end of the programme a lead academic supervisor accompanied by multiple academic supervisors will agree upon a business related project with the apprentice’s employer and the apprentices based on the apprentice’s job role and specialism that they are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. the independent assessor of the epa (end point assessment) should present the meeting for finalising the topic for capstone project. if the apprentice or their employer needs to change the capstone project scope they must resubmit a project form for the epa assessor to approve. the agreed project will present a typical business task, appropriate for demonstrating the skills and knowledge on the standard. in every project there will be a research component and a strong design, programming and/or analytic element. project definition and planning: the agreed project will be comparable in terms of content and complexity for all apprentices – it is the context within which the knowledge, and skills must be demonstrated that will vary. the project is undertaken and completed on programme and pre gateway to the epa (end point assessment). supervision: each project has a lead supervisor and second supervisor, both staff from the school. additional supervision support may be provided by the apprentice’s employer. the apprentice and lead supervisor will meet regularly throughout the period of the project. research: background research will be undertaken in the selected topic with access to the library and online resources. development and software engineering skills: the core of the project will involve carrying out the project plan largely independently, but with guidance from the supervisors. project report: a project report will be prepared, describing the technical background, the work undertaken, the analysis of results and directions for further work. guidance on the style and content of a report will be provided by means of lectures and through the supervisor. project presentation: a mini show and share peers of their six month project, and as a way to bring a celebratory closure to the program. to be able to describe and discus: the various inputs, statements of requirements, security considerations and constraints that guide solution architecture and the development of logical

This module, generally, discusses security principles and considerations for software engineering, including concepts like data management. Looking in the table, we see **LAW3051** and **LAW3251** have been listed with a cosine similarity of 0.703038, which is fairly high.

A student who studied **CSC8423/CSC8430** may wish to learn more on the subject, from more of a legal standpoint; through this methodology they may find **LAW3051/LAW3251** and thus enquire into this other, similar module. Similarly, a module lead for **CSC8423/CSC8430** may wish to encorporate more robust legal content into the module, and might hence consult with a module lead from **LAW3051/LAW3251**.\n","\n","There are many other applications of the output of this modelling. For example, a lecturer from the school of mathematics, statistics and physics may wish to teach a course on security principles and considerations for mathematical programming, not knowing that a very similar set of teaching exists under **CSC8423/8430** with the school of computing. They could then write a set of prose in the format of the module catalogue entries to detail what their module would contain. This would then get modelled by the Transformer and have its similar document embeddings found. By this, the lecturer would then see that a module similar to the subject of what they wish to teach already exists, **CSC8423/8430**, and may instead discuss with the module lead of this existing course how they might be able to accomodate their wish to teach the subject."],"metadata":{"id":"26m9r1tjFkp7"}}]}
