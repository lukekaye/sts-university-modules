engineering process from requirements, design, through to development and testing. the module also puts a particular emphasis on the ethical, legal and social considerations of software engineering when applied to the workplace. *apprentices and their employers who wish to apply a project from their workplace must consult with the module leader to ensure the scope is manageable in the semester, and the project criteria is met. the module will cover cyber security: o the need for security o foundations of security o privacy o practical security o information governance: ethical, legal and social issues involved in data management and analysis ethical, social and legal consideration in cyber security to be able to describe and discuss: the information governance requirements that exist in the uk, and the relevant organisational and legislative data protection and data security standards that exist the basic tenets of computer security: confidentiality, integrity and availability authentication and access control problems and their solutions introduction to symmetric and asymmetric (public key) cryptography examples of uses of cryptography for confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non repudiation examples of secure protocols a selection of security modelling techniques security engineering methodology ethical, social and legal concerns in data and information systems apprentices will be able to: present an analysis of the security considerations of a given system detect vulnerabilities and threats in an existing system formulate a practical security

systems, possibly impacting the information managed by such system. it is crucial for system users, designers and maintainers to learn how to detect, prevent and respond to these attacks. this module aims to cover a broad range of information and system security concepts, focusing on the underpinning theory behind attacks and mechanisms, supported by up to date research papers, as well as some real world examples.  cryptography, security protocols network and distributed system security hardware security security of emerging systems usability security risk definition/assessment/management

topics such as the need for security, system and network security, cryptography, privacy and practical security, including hardware, software and human elements of security, this module aims to introduce the need for security in many components of a computer system: hardware, network, databases, web applications, operating systems and user interface. the need for security: threat and risk modelling. system security: authentication (password, biometrics), access control, malicious code execution, user behaviour. network security: tcp/ip firewall, intrusion detection, routing attacks. cryptography: simple introduction to symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing and signature. privacy: k anonymity. practical security: conduct attacks in a controlled environment. to be able to: identify the basic tenets of computer security: confidentiality, integrity and availability. discuss authentication problems and their solutions. discuss access control problems and their solutions. discuss security modelling and its uses. define symmetric and asymmetric (public key) cryptography, including some common cryptographic algorithms. discuss uses of cryptography for confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non repudiation. recognise some examples of secure protocols. recognise the purpose of a firewall, and some of the techniques required in its construction. define a number of authentication mechanisms. define a selection of security modelling techniques. define the security engineering methodology to be able to: present an analysis of the security of a given system use real attacks tools (e.g. kali linux)in a controlled environment detect vulnerabilities and threats in an existing system formulate a practical security solution to a problem, making effective use of time and resources available.   \n","6

exploited by attackers. users are often wrongly portrayed as “the weakest link”, when the problem lies in the lack of a usable and secure system. the security analysis of a complex system therefore requires a holistic approach, leveraging a range of techniques. the aim of this module is to study techniques required for complex systems, using concrete case studies as well as exploring possible future attacks. the module covers, through the study of research papers and technical reports, attacks against complex systems, as well as techniques to detect, respond to and prevent such attacks. the complex systems studied during the module will reflect current research and technical challenges, for example: industrial control systems and cyber physical infrastructure, social engineering techniques, human aspects of security, forensics analysis, or machine learning based intrusion and misuse detection.  security of complex systems (e.g., industrial control systems, smart grids) sophisticated attack mechanisms (e.g., adversarial machine learning) usable security and privacy social engineering techniques the ability to describe and discuss: the interaction of security of social, cyber and physical aspects in complex systems, and their impact on the security of the whole system. the role of human users in the security and privacy of complex systems. the possible security mechanisms to detect, respond to and prevent attacks against complex systems.  the ability to analyse and summarise key research papers related to the security of complex systems. the ability to suggest and recommend security mechanisms for a specific complex system.   \n","7

for system users, designers and maintainers to learn how to detect, prevent and respond to these attacks. this course aims to cover a wide range of attacks, such as man in the middle and api attacks, and to introduce relevant security mechanisms, such as cryptographic techniques and network analysis tool. the material covers the underpinning theory behind attacks and mechanisms, supported by up to date research papers, as well as some real world examples.  cryptography security protocols network and distributed system security hardware security security of emerging systems usability. the

module is to develop skills to select and apply tools for carrying out security testing strategies including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and ethical hacking. this module will look at a range of security tools and analysis, covering: definition of ethical hacking network analysis (including host discovery and traffic analysis) web application analysis (including xss and vulnerability reporting) operating system analysis (including privilege escalation and buffer exploitation) the ability to describe and discuss: how to select and tools and techniques to carry out a variety of security testing strategies the fundamentals of ethical hacking the ability to: plan and carry out testing a variety of security testing strategies identify, investigate and correlate actionable security events conduct a vulnerability assessment conduct analysis of attacker tools   \n","9

guarantee the complete security of a system, and a cyber security analyst often aims instead to reveal gaps in security provisioning. the aim of this module is to develop skills to select and apply tools and techniques for carrying out security testing strategies including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and ethical hacking.  this module will look at a range of security tools and analysis, covering: definition of ethical hacking network analysis (such as host discovery and traffic analysis) web application analysis (such as xss and vulnerability reporting) operating system analysis (such as privilege escalation and buffer exploitation) cryptography analysis (such as brute force on hashing) malware analysis (such as reverse engineering and intrusion detection) forensics analysis (such as steganography and log analysis) the ability to describe and discuss: how to select and tools and techniques to carry out a variety of security testing strategies the fundamentals of ethical hacking the ability to: plan and carry out testing a variety of security testing strategies identify, investigate and correlate actionable security events conduct a vulnerability assessment select and apply cyber forensic tools and techniques for attack reconstruction conduct analysis of attacker tools   \n","11

role and the specialism that you are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. you are expected to solve real world problems with focus on live business scenarios, that demonstrate your specialist expertise in the project topic. and further improve and demonstrate your professional development skills. you will work closely with your employer and the apprenticeship tutor. specifically, the module aims to equip the apprentices with the following knowledge and skills: to deepen the core professional competencies and cyber security specialist ksbs (knowledge, skills, and behaviours) acquired in the programme through practice. to develop an awareness of the range and limitations of technologies available. to develop an awareness of the real world problems in cyber security. toward the end of the programme a lead academic supervisor accompanied by multiple academic supervisors will agree upon a business related project with the apprentice’s employer and the apprentices based on the apprentice’s job role and specialism that they are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. the independent assessor of the epa (end point assessment) should present the meeting for finalising the topic for capstone project. if the apprentice or their employer needs to change the capstone project scope they must resubmit a project form for the epa assessor to approve. the agreed project will present a typical business task, appropriate for demonstrating the skills and knowledge on the standard. in every project there will be a research component and a strong design, programming and/or analytic element. project definition and planning: the agreed project will be comparable in terms of content and complexity for all apprentices – it is the context within which the knowledge, and skills must be demonstrated that will vary. the project is undertaken and completed on programme and pre gateway to the epa (end point assessment). the project itself is not part of the epa. supervision: each project has at least one academic supervisor from the school and one partner supervisor from the apprentice’s employer. the apprentices and the supervisor will meet regularly throughout the period of the project. research: background research will be undertaken in the selected topic with access to the library and online resources. development and analytics skills: the core of the project will involve carrying out the project plan largely independently, but with guidance from the supervisors. project report: a project report will be prepared, describing the technical background, the work undertaken, the analysis of results and directions for further work. guidance on the style and content of a report will be provided by means of lectures and through the supervisor. project presentation: apprentices will demonstrate their ability to communicate their work to the stakeholders to be able to describe and discuss: identify, investigate and correlate actionable security events, including performing network traffic analysis using a range of techniques relevant to the security of communication networks to assess security risks and escalating where appropriate; the principles of threat intelligence, modelling and assessment. the range of modern attack techniques and how and where to research emerging attack techniques to inform the development of improved security controls, countermeasures and policies and standards; how to use human factor analysis in the assessment of threats, including the motivations and methods adopted by a wide range of human threat actors; how to select and apply tools and techniques to carry out a variety of security testing strategies including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and ethical hacking, recognising that security testing itself cannot guarantee security and only reveal gaps in security provisioning; how to develop and implement security event response programmes, security event handling, and operational security activities; the different types of cyber security controls that can be implemented, the main principles of secure configuration of security components and devices, including firewalls and protective monitoring tools and how to apply them. demonstrate the following four core skills: identify, document, review and design complex it enabled business processes that define a set of activities that will accomplish specific organisational goals and provides a systematic approach to improving those processes; professionally present digital and technology solution specialism plans and solutions in a well structured business report; demonstrate self direction and originality in solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing digital and technology solutions specialist tasks at a professional level; be competent at negotiating and closing techniques in a range of interactions and engagements, both with senior internal and external stakeholders; demonstrate the following five cyber security skills: the principles of threat intelligence, modelling and

understanding of the issues and practicalities of security and the adoption of various programming paradigms when designing systems and resolving problems. this module gives students first hand experience of using a range of modern programming paradigms to implement mechanisms which help address key security issues related to software applications and associated data. this module explores several security topics using different programming paradigms. we will consider the characteristics and implications of prevalent programming paradigms including object oriented, database query, logic and functional; as well as other common paradigms such as scripting and web. the security topics include input validation, code injection, access control, authentication and quality of code. we will investigate existing code including reverse engineering to enable more secure development. to be able to: assess and compare the semantics and practice of using multiple programming paradigms in various application areas. address the main security challenges in software development. to be able to: read and understand code written using different programming paradigms. expand and extend existing programmes. implement solutions to a range of security problems using different development paradigms.   \n","15

introduced to emerging technologies and innovations in digital technologies. apprentices will learn how to apply some of the topics in emerging technologies (such as those related of distributed systems) to programming. by combining their knowledge and skills of programming with the understanding of digital technologies, apprentices will be able to decipher and review the existing codes underlying the technology. they will also perform requirements and cost benefit analyses of a technology within the context of their workplace setting. this exercise will challenge apprentice’ ability to handle unexpected situations in their workplace. apprentices are expected to negotiate with internal and external stakeholders within an organisation, write reports and deliver presentations directed at influential members in an organisation. the module will cover emerging technologies o review and discuss emerging technologies. in addition to topics related to distributed systems technologies such as cloud computing, internet of things and blockchain, this may also include: artificial intelligence, data science, and smart cities. o conduct a cost benefit to determine which emerging technology would be suitable for stakeholder software development for emerging technologies o development for distributed applications o building iot applications o iot and blockchain o iot

research literature to provide an insight into current and future developments in computer systems to reflect on the experience of applying the techniques taught in preceding modules to the safety, security and resilience analysis and development of a high integrity computing system to gain experience of working in groups to complete a set of specified tasks in a timely manner which would involve literature review, software design, implementation, presentation of design and demonstration of the implemented system. this module aims to provide students an opportunity to research the literature on a given safety/security/resilience topic in computing, to collaborate on a literature review and to design, build and analyse a high integrity computing system with security or safety implications. students will have access to technical guidance from faculty members, but will essentially work as a small independent team under their own initiative. this provides an opportunity to practice the technical skills developed in other modules, to develop new skills of cooperative working and organization, and to develop research skills in preparation for their individual project and dissertation module. the module is structured in several phases: lecture materials (delivered possibly online) on research methods: introduction to research projects and planning; identifying information need; assessing quality and reliability of sources of information role of peer review in research and system development critical evaluation of published material how to present claims with supporting arguments academic report writing; standards in the discipline; use and citation of sources ethical issues research topics are assigned and groups of members are allocated by module leaders, mixing backgrounds, abilities and skills. groups work together, forming reading circles to collaboratively produce a literature review. groups begin work on the software development exercise. choice of group organisation is left to the group. development will involve research, requirements elicitation, modelling and safety analysis which may involve information flow modelling, protocol design, deductive or inductive fault analysis. selection of development methods and tools will be done by each group. an online presentation is given by groups in week together with group and individual report, which should include a risk assessment of the proposed solution. to be able to describe and discuss: the sources of information and standards of information quality that apply in computing science generally. current challenges in research and topics of concern in industry and professional practice. state of current research in a particular technology or application area the challenges involved in planning a system development in which exploiting the best features of the available tools and middleware systems issues that relate to the planning and execution of a team based software project, at an advanced level the ability to: conduct a critical evaluation of technical literature in computing science form an argument based on presentation and analysis of relevant evidence cooperate in a team take a significant role in a team collaborative exercise communicate in written reports, verbally and in a presentation plan project development activities working within resource limitations select appropriate technology for a safety and resilience analysis, taking account of professional, legal and ethical aspects   \n","27

               real world industry led challenges in data science require an academic foundation in statistics and computer science combined with domain knowledge, practical resourcefulness and research skills. this module aims to equip students with the following knowledge and skills: to develop domain knowledge through active learning to develop practical experience of operations that influence data sources origins and data streams to develop an understand of the ethical, legal and social implications of data science projects to develop an understanding of business acumen, commercial risk and professional skills in data science to develop an understanding of frameworks for project, time and team management to develop research skills in data science this module covers the principles of research and professional skills that are essential to data science practice. the taught content is complemented by practical experience where the students embed themselves in a suitable institute or immerse themselves in a research area to gain domain knowledge. insights gained from this experience are then used to propose a data science project within that company, institute or area of research and evaluate the merits of the proposal based on each of taught topics listed. the data science industry business models, intellectual property and management project, time and team management ethics and governance in data science technical and institutional readiness for data science research skills and critical evaluation of data and literature sources to be able to describe and discuss: how businesses can benefit from data science the origins of data in a chosen institute, field or industry the legal and ethical implications of handling public and private data the ability to demonstrate: communication with technical and non technical stakeholders in a data science project critical analysis of information sources application of ethics and governance

amazon). the aim is to gain experience of working in groups and to design and implement software under time and resource constraints.  the project begins with a hour lecture in which presented are the functional specification of the system that needs to be built, and (ii) a set of increasingly harder protocols that implement the system with a higher degree of sophistication. the students will be asked to divide themselves into groups of no less than and no more than group membership will be determined by the students themselves, who will however be encouraged to find members with diverse backgrounds, abilities and skills. in particular, a good mix of system programmers, protocol analyzers, and software engineers would be deemed beneficial. module leader will be the monitor for each group, who may give advice if asked, and who will give advice if any mis understanding of the problem specification or of the protocols is observed. choice of implementation technology (e.g., corba) is left to the group member, and also the choice of protocols. whilst the end product is a documented piece of software, the way the students operate as a group is an important aspect of this module.

should by end of module be able to demonstrate an understanding of the implications of the arrival of the internet and networked information and communications in our society and how it has created new legal conflicts in most areas of law. they should then be able to identify legal frameworks of regulation with which to analyse and/or resolve such conflicts students should be able to identify the applicable national and regional laws for the legal issues examined in the module and also to analyse the legal, technological, societal, political and other challenges and conflicts these areas entail. they should demonstrate an understanding of the global framework of internet law, and a background understanding of the international human rights and governance structures relevant to the area. will vary as topical events impact on what is a very dynamic area but typically drawn from: intro/ regulation of the internet privacy/ data protection :introduction to privacy, dp principles and user rights data protection 2: user rights data protection / e commerce 3: cookies, spam, profiling, marketing algorithms, machine learning, and ai : regulation of transparency and profiling state surveillance and “surveillance capitalism” online intermediaries “online harms” and intermediaries : trolling, abuse, terror and fake news cybercrime high technology topics e.g. digital assets: ai; driverless cars; care robots ; ai and the legal profession the internet has come to dominate our society over the last twenty or so years and now is of vital significance to our work and social lives, to our mental health, to our educational development and to our democratic norms. in the commercial world, the internet has transformed delivery of services and goods and expanded consumer choice and power. in terms of dysfunction, the internet has created now opportunities and venues for crime, disorder, harassment and abuse. there are arguments that the internet has transformed us into a surveillance society and that privacy is dead. all of these affect a wide variety of regulations and laws. more than this though the internet has ushered in the idea that we are as much governed by the software and hardware around us as by laws : the idea that “law is code”. it has also exposed the power not just of traditional law and policy makers but also of the private sector; and it has exposed national laws to the reality that data flows seamlessly across borders. the internet is thus a transnational legal phenomenon. the module will attempt to put over these ideas suing a series of topics drawn from privacy, data protection, e commerce, cybercrime and security, free speech and censorship online etc. there will be a particular emphasis on newer “ai” related topics such as machine learning, profiling, robots, driverless cars etc. after completing this module, learners will be able to demonstrate critical knowledge and understanding of: the economic, social, technological and historical factors important to the rise of the internet the legal instruments and principles which are key to looking at governance of the internet, including uk, eu and us legal sources as well as international human rights. the commercial, social, technological and cultural barriers to enforcement and application of law online. the notions of regulation by “code” and associated ideas such as pots (privacy optimising technologies.)  students should be able to work, individually and in groups, to provide summaries and analyses of relevant legal issues; and participate as required in group discussions and presentations, thus demonstrating oral as well as written skills, as well as coordination and completion of tasks to specifications. students should demonstrate the ability to undertake independent research on internet law topics as required throughout the course and for the essay assignment . they should show the ability to access both primary legal source materials and secondary materials, including online material; understand when each is appropriate; and use correct legal citation style. students should demonstrate the ability to understand and use the english language proficiently in relation to internet law issues; to present knowledge or an argument in a way which is comprehensible to others, even under time pressures; and to read and understand internet law materials which are written in technical and complex language.   \n","31

                      this module aims to equip apprentices with the technical and practical experience to function as successful software engineering practitioners. it will provide apprentices with a project based challenge that requires them to learn and apply their skills to design, implement and run a three tier business application end to end in java (that is, from client to database), previously learned skills in web technologies, human computer interaction, project management and software engineering processes. in this module, the apprentices will design, develop, and manage a software engineering project and its timeline following agile, lean or other industry recognized approaches. they will be able to transfer the understanding of three tier socket based applications to a web based setting (based on http). they will apply hci methodologies to design a product driven by user experience that incorporates an extended knowledge of java. further, they will create a presentation based on their product for stakeholders. the module will cover: advanced programming: o server side programming o common data structures and manipulation of collections of objects. o concurrent programming introduction to database systems to be able to (k2) describe & discuss advanced features of java programming including: concurrent programming, server programming (k1, k2) explain the relevant technology underlying web content delivery and presentation (k2, k4) describe database system design and use degree apprenticeship standards the outcomes listed above support the

 to introduce the design and implementation of software systems. there are factors that we must take into account when designing and implementing software systems that either do not arise in application development or are less critical in application development. these include the longevity of systems compared to applications, agreement on shared abstractions that are often codified in interfaces and standards, and the conservation of resources to maximise their availability to applications. this module gives students an appreciation of such factors and their implications for good design and software development in general. operating systems and their extension to networks of systems are used as exemplars. the lessons drawn from their design and implementation are applicable not only to other systems but also to good applications design. the appreciation of their general applicability and the trade offs involved will inform any future software development students undertake. the module is directly related to and builds on the stage module csc1032 on computer systems design and architectures. the module is organised into three strands: operating systems, networks of systems and practical systems development work that complements and exemplifies the other two strands. in operating systems, the focus will be on processes and memory management, scheduling and the need for, and mechanisms to achieve, inter process communication and concurrency control. in networks we cover the fundamental abstractions presented by the internet, with a particular focus on achieving reliable communication over an unreliable network of networks. specific topics covered in the theoretical strands include: the process model and process lifecycle process address space and isolation and virtual memory process implementation scheduling requirements and algorithms concurrent execution and mechanisms for data sharing the mutual exclusion problem and the implementation of solutions network topologies network protocols network layers and their realisation in tcp/ip internetworking and reliable communication to be able to: apply the principles and practice of systems design and development review and apply the principles and practice of resource sharing and management identify, analyse and resolve concurrency problems in practice analyse,

them reason abstractly about the structure and behaviour of software systems program at the systems level apply concurrency control mechanisms analyse the requirements for a network system think

overview of the concepts of reliability, and a systems approach to the design, evaluation, and implementation of fault tolerance in computer systems, exemplified by case studies of present day systems. the module aims to provide an overview of the concepts of reliability and a systems approach to the design, evaluation and implementation of fault tolerance in computer systems exemplified by case studies of present day systems. topics covered in the syllabus include: need for reliability, system dependability concepts and terminology; fault tolerance principles; error detection and recovery; software and hardware fault tolerance; case studies from mars and delta 4. need for reliability: faults as the sources of unreliability; anticipated and unanticipated faults; fault prevention and fault tolerance approaches to achieving reliability. system dependability concepts and terminology: failures, error, design and component faults. fault tolerance: principles, error detection, damage assessment, error recovery, fault treatment; redundancy; tomorrow systems; programming with exception and exception handlers. error detection: ideal measures for error detection; replication checks; timing checks; coding checks. error recovery: forward and backward error recovery; their advantages and limitations; implementation issues in backward error recovery; co operating processes and recovery lines. software fault tolerance: n version programming, recovery blocks. hardware fault tolerance: fault classification and replication strategies; need for agreement among replicas; evaluation of redundancy requirements. case studies mars, delta 4 to be able to: discuss the principles of fault tolerance identify various dependability requirements explain system structure and behaviour identify the four common phases of fault tolerance distinguish fault, error, and failure distinguish forward error recovery from backward error recovery explain how recovery

application. it will consider how new geospatial sensors and technology (satellite, drones, social media, iot and sensor networks) is changing the academic, industry and business landscape raising important questions regarding data privacy and confidentiality. the ethical, legal and social considerations will be investigated both within academic and also the wider geospatial and applied

practical experience of large scale software development. this module gives students the opportunity to work within a team situation that simulates a real world environment. the project work draws on several topics covered in lectures including project planning where you must define an organisational structure for your team. next you will have to choose a software design methodology, plan out the software design, estimate the amount of work needed, consider the schedule for implementation to meet the deadlines set, and allocate the work. you will need to consider the plan for testing your software. you will need to plan the software integration, testing and the final demonstration and throughout the whole process there will be the planning and allocation of documentation tasks and report writing. the class will be divided into a number of teams with around seven students in each team. team membership will be determined by the module leader expect to find in your team students with diverse backgrounds, abilities and skills. some students will be competent programmers, others will have limited capabilities in this area but have skills in other areas such as documentation, organisation, communication etc. you will need to make the most of the skills within your team and allocate tasks and roles accordingly. whilst the end product is a documented piece of software, the way you operate as a team is an important aspect of this module. you are expected to hold a formal team meeting once each week. software engineering software processes life cycle and process models

iot m2m network technology including networking, system frameworks and comparative study. skills in implementation of m2m networks.  interfaces of sensors/actuators and their connectors to the iot router; internet interfaces for iot routers, their representation in osi reference model; iot router architecture, framework and framework connectors; architectures, platforms and applications for m2m iot systems; coursework: design of a simple m2m iot system, physical implementation, experimentation, analysis and report. upon completion of this module a student will be able to evaluate and design an m2m communication infrastructure based on the analysis of a specific iot application . this is achieved by classification of the features of the m2m application and attributing them to the corresponding levels of the osi reference model (5 , which has to be based on a solid foundation of the knowledge of the principles and protocols of a representative set of interfaces. the articles (1 correspond to the six levels of the cognitive domain of bloom's taxonomy (evaluation synthesis analysis application comprehension knowledge correspondingly), whose specific content is included in outline of syllabus section. this is a design based coursework module, which develops and assesses all these levels in a coherent way with an added benefit of developing practical skills outlined in the skill outcomes section.  distributed system design with m2m, a specific practical example. design with an open source platform for m2m, skill development in using it. analytical skills for analysis of iot specifications and evaluation of the implemented solution. a skill of evaluation of a particular technology in a broader technical and societal context. report writing skills,

sometimes called motes, collect environmental data (such as location, speed, temperature, humidity and sound level) or, more recently, medical data (such as heart rate, blood oxygen level and pulse rate). the data is collected across the network, aggregated and fed into data processing iot applications. sensor and actuator networks, telemetry, data processing, distributed data bases, machine vision, ai and analytics are enablers for iot applications across multiple disciplines, including environmental monitoring and control, agricultural monitoring, healthcare, habitat monitoring and military surveillance. in order to successfully design and build scalable application systems in the iot, a range of knowledge and skills are needed. this module will introduce and examine the core concepts, theoretical underpinnings and software frameworks relevant to the iot. it will describe the network protocols, hardware resources, data programming models, and virtualization technologies from which the iot cloud infrastructure and applications are constructed. methods for building scalable iot applications that span across multiple parts of infrastructure (sensor, edge, and cloud) will be described and explained. case studies drawn from industrial applications of iot will be used throughout to motivate the teaching and learning process. the syllabus will cover following topics: iot theory, concepts, components and delivery models iot architecture and topologies sensors and actuators in iot iot standards and communication protocols fundamentals of software defined networking and its role in iot issues and challenges in building iot applications iot data management and data integration iot knowledge graph and data fusion iot and blockchain iot in context of cloud computing and analytics iot and edge/fog computing to be able to describe and discuss: how businesses and society can benefit from the iot paradigm the role of iot of data for automatic decision making

societies. more specifically, it explains how to enable changes in the business context, organisational designs, business strategies, business models and innovation management. this module will, therefore, begin by providing students with a solid understanding of core is concepts and how developments in such systems have enabled the so called e business phenomenon. the module will focus on what is are used by organisations for internal and external operations, such as the automation of business processes in the marketing or supply chain areas. these topics will be complemented by other related areas including is development, managing is projects as well as technical and security aspects. where appropriate guest lectures will be given. i) module overview/what is an is? ii) business

exemplified by case studies of present day systems. the module aims to provide an overview of the concepts of reliability and a systems approach to the design, evaluation and implementation of fault tolerance in computer systems exemplified by case studies of present day systems. topics covered in the syllabus include: need for reliability, system dependability concepts and terminology; fault tolerance principles; error detection and recovery; software and hardware fault tolerance; case studies from mars and delta 4. need for reliability: faults as the sources of unreliability; anticipated and unanticipated faults; fault prevention and fault tolerance approaches to achieving reliability. system dependability concepts and terminology: failures, error, design and component faults. fault tolerance: principles, error detection, damage assessment, error recovery, fault treatment; redundancy; tomorrow systems; programming with exception and exception handlers. error detection: ideal measures for error detection; replication checks; timing checks; coding checks. error recovery: forward and backward error recovery; their advantages and limitations; implementation issues in backward error recovery; co operating processes and recovery lines. software fault tolerance: n version programming, recovery blocks. hardware fault tolerance: fault calssification and replication strategies; need for agreement among replicas; evaluation of redundancy requirements. case studies mars, delta 4  to be able to discuss the principles of fault tolerance to be able to identify various

apprentices with a project based challenge that requires them to learn and apply their skills in advanced programming and web technologies, previously learned skills in human computer interaction, project management and software engineering processes. in this module, the apprentices will design, develop, and manage a software engineering project and its timeline following agile, lean or other industry recognized approaches. they will apply hci methodologies to design a product driven by user experience that incorporates an extended knowledge of java. further, they will create a presentation based on their product for stakeholders. *apprentices and their employers who wish to apply a project from their workplace must consult with the module leader to ensure the scope is manageable in the semester, and the project criteria are met. please note that this module focuses on group work. employers must be able to give the apprentice a project that includes group work throughout. the module will cover: advanced programming: o server side programming o common data structures and manipulation of collections of objects. o concurrent programming introduction to database systems web technologies: o basic languages (e.g. html, css, javascript). o forms & scripts. o client server development. o web/database integration. to be able to o (k2) describe & discuss

                        this individual work based project is a substantial piece of independent work which is designed based on your job role and the specialism that you are undertaking as part of the software engineering master’s level degree apprenticeship. you will have the opportunity to solve real world problem focus on live business scenarios in your workplace, develop your own specialist expertise in the project, and further improve and demonstrate your professional development skills. you will work closely with your employer and the apprenticeship tutor. specifically, the module aims to equip the apprentices with the following knowledge and skills: to deepen the knowledge, skills and behaviours acquired in the degree apprenticeship programme through practice. to develop an awareness of the range and limitations of technologies available. to develop an awareness of the real world problems in software engineering. toward the end of the programme a lead academic supervisor accompanied by multiple academic supervisors will agree upon a business related project with the apprentice’s employer and the apprentices based on the apprentice’s job role and specialism that they are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. the independent assessor of the epa (end point assessment) should present the meeting for finalising the topic for capstone project. if the apprentice or their employer needs to change the capstone project scope they must resubmit a project form for the epa assessor to approve. the agreed project will present a typical business task, appropriate for demonstrating the skills and knowledge on the standard. in every project there will be a research component and a strong design, programming and/or analytic element. project definition and planning: the agreed project will be comparable in terms of content and complexity for all apprentices – it is the context within which the knowledge, and skills must be demonstrated that will vary. the project is undertaken and completed on programme and pre gateway to the epa (end point assessment). supervision: each project has a lead supervisor and second supervisor, both staff from the school. additional supervision support may be provided by the apprentice’s employer. the apprentice and lead supervisor will meet regularly throughout the period of the project. research: background research will be undertaken in the selected topic with access to the library and online resources. development and software engineering skills: the core of the project will involve carrying out the project plan largely independently, but with guidance from the supervisors. project report: a project report will be prepared, describing the technical background, the work undertaken, the analysis of results and directions for further work. guidance on the style and content of a report will be provided by means of lectures and through the supervisor. project presentation: a mini show and share peers of their six month project, and as a way to bring a celebratory closure to the program. to be able to describe and discus: the various inputs, statements of requirements, security considerations and constraints that guide solution architecture and the development of logical and physical systems’ designs; the methodologies designed to

when designing and implementing software systems that either do not arise in application development or are less critical in application development. these include the longevity of systems compared to applications, agreement on shared abstractions that are often codified in interfaces and standards, and the conservation of resources to maximise their availability to applications. this module gives students an appreciation of such factors and their implications for good design and software development in general. operating systems and their extension to networks of systems are used as exemplars. the lessons drawn from their design and implementation are applicable not only to other systems but also to good applications design. the appreciation of their general applicability and the trade offs involved will inform any future software development students undertake. the module is directly related to and builds on the stage module csc1032 on computer systems design and architectures. the module is organised into three strands: operating systems, networks of systems and practical systems development work that complements and exemplifies the other two strands. in operating systems, the focus will be on processes and memory management, scheduling and the need for, and mechanisms to achieve, inter process communication and concurrency control. in networks we cover the fundamental abstractions presented by the internet, with a particular focus on achieving reliable communication over an unreliable network of networks. specific topics covered in the theoretical strands include:

work closely with your employer and the apprenticeship tutor. specifically, the module aims to equip the apprentices with the following knowledge and skills: to deepen the knowledge, skills and behaviours acquired in the degree apprenticeship programme through practice. to develop an awareness of the range and limitations of technologies available. to develop an awareness of the real world problems in software engineering. toward the end of the programme a lead academic supervisor accompanied by multiple academic supervisors will agree upon a business related project with the apprentice’s employer and the apprentices based on the apprentice’s job role and specialism that they are undertaking as part of the digital and technology solution specialist master’s degree. the independent assessor of the epa (end point assessment) should present the meeting for finalising the topic for capstone project. if the apprentice or their employer needs to change the capstone project scope they must resubmit a project form for the epa assessor to approve. the agreed project will present a typical business task, appropriate for demonstrating the skills and knowledge on the standard. in every project there will be a research component and a strong design, programming and/or analytic element. project definition and planning: the agreed project will be comparable in terms of content and complexity for all apprentices – it is the context within which the knowledge, and skills must be demonstrated that will vary. the project is undertaken and completed on programme and pre gateway to the epa (end point assessment). supervision: each project has a lead supervisor and second supervisor, both staff from the school. additional supervision support may be provided by the apprentice’s employer. the apprentice and lead supervisor will meet regularly throughout the period of the project. research: background research will be undertaken in the selected topic with access to the library and online resources. development and software engineering skills: the core of the project will involve carrying out the project plan largely independently, but with guidance from the supervisors. project report: a project report will be prepared, describing the technical background, the work undertaken, the analysis of results and directions for further work. guidance on the style and content of a report will be provided by means of lectures and through the supervisor. project presentation: a mini show and share peers of their six month project, and as a way to bring a

This module, generally, discusses security principles and considerations for software engineering, including concepts like data management. Looking in the table, we see that generally other modules within the Computing school are found as similar, as you would expect, with many of these modules being very similar. More interestingly however, looking at index 30, **LAW3051** and **LAW3251**, from the Law school, have been listed with a cosine similarity of 0.650249, which is fairly high. Indeed, reading the text for this module we see that it refers to the legality of the internet and networked information, referencing concepts such as digital assets.\n","\n","These modules are semantically similar enough to the point of interest. A student who studied **CSC8423/CSC8430** may wish to learn more on the subject, from more of a legal standpoint; through this methodology they may find **LAW3051/LAW3251** and thus enquire into this other, similar module. Similarly, a module lead for **CSC8423/CSC8430** may wish to encorporate more robust legal content into the module, and might hence consult with a module lead from **LAW3051/LAW3251**.\n","\n","There are many other applications of the output of this modelling. For example, a lecturer from the school of mathematics, statistics and physics may wish to teach a course on security principles and considerations for mathematical programming, not knowing that a very similar set of teaching exists under **CSC8423/8430** with the school of computing. They could then write a set of prose in the format of the module catalogue entries to detail what their module would contain. This would then get modelled by the Transformer and have its similar document embeddings found. By this, the lecturer would then see that a module similar to the subject of what they wish to teach already exists, **CSC8423/8430**, and may be able to borrow ideas from this already existing module."],"metadata":{"id":"26m9r1tjFkp7"}}]}
